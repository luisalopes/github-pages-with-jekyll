# Hello, dear ghost reader

I'd like to introduce myself.

Please, call me Lou.
I'm a non-binary Literature & Linguistics graduate that quickly developped interest in programming through Linguistics.
My ultimate goal is to be able to work with A.I., but for now, I'm just trying to grasp the basics.
As a first goal, I have a book-related project that has really no shape of its own for now. I hope that, as I learn more about some programming languages, I'll start to devise a plan in a more substantial manner so I can finally start working on it and receiving feedback about my skills as I learn.

You're free to look around, but for now there's nothing aside from this small "About Me" block. I hope I can add some more exciting things as I practice.

Welcome and, until further notice, see ya! :wave:
